# API Request/Response

Write code in `main.js` that requests data from the following URL (https://criminals.glassdale.us/criminals). Your task is to output the following string template for each criminal - either to the console or the DOM.

```txt
${criminal name} was convicted of ${crime} and was arrested by ${arresting officer}
```

You must be able to identify and demonstrate how to inspect the Request URL and the response data from the API.
